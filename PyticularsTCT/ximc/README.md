The latest version of this library can be found [here](https://doc.xisupport.com/en/8smc5-usb/8SMCn-USB/Programming/Programming_guide.html), more specifically [here](http://files.xisupport.com/Software.en.html#development-kit). What I did is to download [this file](http://files.xisupport.com/libximc/libximc-2.13.3-all.tar.gz) and then explored the examples to see how they load the libraries.
